# ✨ Introduction

Ragas is a library that helps you move from "vibe checks" to systematic evaluation loops for your AI applications. It provides tools to supercharge the evaluation of Large Language Model (LLM) applications, enabling you to evaluate your LLM applications with ease and confidence.

## Why Ragas?

Traditional evaluation metrics don't capture what matters for LLM applications. Manual evaluation doesn't scale. Ragas solves this by combining **LLM-driven metrics** with **systematic experimentation** to create a continuous improvement loop.

### Key Features

**Experiments-first approach**: Evaluate changes consistently with `experiments`. Make changes, run evaluations, observe results, and iterate to improve your LLM application.

**Ragas Metrics**: Create custom metrics tailored to your specific use case with simple decorators or use our library of [available metrics](concepts/metrics/available_metrics/). Learn more about [metrics in Ragas](concepts/metrics/overview/).

**Easy to integrate**: Built-in dataset management, result tracking, and integration with popular frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and more.
