# Types Directory

See the root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for project-wide coding standards.

## Scope

Shared TypeScript type definitions.

## Guidelines

- Keep types minimal, descriptive, and stable
- Document exported types with TSDoc
- Use discriminated unions over type assertions
- Prefer `lib/mcp/types.ts` for MCP-related types
